## Hello!

I am a development economist in the making. Currently, I am a second year PhD student in the University of Wisconsin-Madison's AAE program. I hold a MSc in Applied Economics from UW Madison, and a double BA in Economics and International Relations from ITAM (Mexico City). I have previously worked as a Research Fellow at ITAM and Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Business.
